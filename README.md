# DrugDiscoveryML
messing around with drug discovery and machine-learning

### Purpose
The objective of this repository is to address pharmacokinetics issues with drug discovery and if/how can machine-learning help on this issue while learning myself. Any input is welcomed.

### How to
The import cleans the data and imports a subset from chembl_23 and eache one of the assays works from there 

### Assays
There are testing issues for logP, Protein Binding and Aqueous solubility

### Results so far
Solubility

### TODO
* Bioavailability
* Clean code and readability
* Improve results
* Introduce DrugBank Information
* ...
